# GPT Solving Konkour
ChatGPT Solving 1403 Math Konkour Problems

## Questions and Answers

## Consideration
Since `ChatGPT-o1-preview` model has a limit of 30 messages per week, I asked only 10 (kinda random) questions (1/4 of all the math problems) and multiplied my results by 4. 

## Results
GPT scored %100, in 134 seconds. However, at first the score was %80 due to a weird bug (?) causing GPT to think more than needed. I used `ChatGPT-o1-mini` to see if it failed too or not. Surprisingly `o1-mini` solved them correctly and did %100.
